They will also advise you to read plenty of medical blogs and articles, which can be helpful in the future."],

Regular hospital shifts along with studying will teach you a lot but relaxing your mind is equally important and is required to keep you fresh. Having a day out with your friends and family will keep you charged and motivated."],
